# Employee-Salary-Prediction

This repository contains a simple machine learning project that predicts salaries based on years of experience using linear regression. The project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook (salarypredict.ipynb).

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates the steps to build a basic supervised learning model. It involves:

Loading and visualizing the dataset

Preprocessing the data

Training a regression model

Evaluating model performance

Making predictions

## 🚀 Technologies Used
Python 🐍

Jupyter Notebook 📓

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Scikit-learn

## 🧠 Model
The notebook uses Linear Regression from scikit-learn to learn the relationship between experience and salary.

## 📊 Results
Visualization of the data and regression line

R² score and model performance metrics

Prediction of salary for new data points
